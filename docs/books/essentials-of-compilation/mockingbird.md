# Mockingbird

A simulator for RISC-V instruction set.

Should use c instead of js.

`RV32I/index`
`RV32I/state/State`

`RV32I/instruction/Instruction`
`RV32I/instructions/`

decode `Instruction`

[maybe] we need a library to operate byte and bit

[maybe] we need a library to operate typed array

# application

learn about riscv asm

write a forth as a test program

desgin a riscv asm language -- maybe embedded in js

# learn

Learn about Memory Consistency Model

some note about ISA desgin

- What are the design constraints?

  - Instruction encoding is constrained by memory addressing.

    In what ways?

- What are the classical solutions?
