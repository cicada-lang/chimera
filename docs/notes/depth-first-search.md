title: Depth-first search
---

For performance reason,
it is import to use [depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
instead of [breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search).

Prolog and minikanren both use depth-first search.

TODO I do not understand why yet.
