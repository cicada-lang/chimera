The goal of this project becomes exploring different models of computation.

Currently we have:

- Functional programming (not pure)
- Logic programming
- Term rewriting
- Hypergraph rewriting

We can also explore:

- Reactive programming (like web frontend reactive framework)
- Propagator model
- Actor model
