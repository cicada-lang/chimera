When we use the concept of partial solution in the solver,
it feels like how a human solve problems.

Just like Turing get his Turing machine
by mimicing human computer.

The implementation is easier to understand
when it feels like how human do things.

The same for term rewriting,
which is how human do logic and mathematics.
