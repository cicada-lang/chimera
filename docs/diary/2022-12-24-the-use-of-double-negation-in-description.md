title: The use of double negation in description

When talking about the Prolog query,
people always use double negation and say
-- we try to prove the goal not satisfiable,
if we find something, we fail to prove not satisfiable,
thus it is satisfiable.

Why not just say, we try to find something to satisfy it?

Maybe because of the form of Horn clause.

But we should always use the easier to understand way in description,
the same as API design, for example, we use the syntax keyword `find`,
the code reads natural.
