A first principle is a model via which other concepts are explained.

By the teaching of Jeremy Siek:

I understand why the book EOPL ("Essentials of Programming Languages")
starts from chapter "Inductive Sets of Data".

I also understand why we say "everything is expressions" in "The Little Typer".

Set theory is a very good starting point to introduce concepts of programming languages:

- Grammar -- the set of expressions.
- Relation -- set of tuples.
- Function -- univalent Relation.
- Inference rule -- definition of judgment (relation) by clauses.
