I found syntax error in code:

 1 |relation border("sussex", "kent")
 2 |


Found the identifier "border" in [9, 15], while expecting:
 ["identifier"]:
     stmt:clause_no_goals_no_name@0 -> "relation"@1 > (name: identifier) (args: args) 
 ["identifier"]:
     stmt:clause_no_goals@0 -> "relation"@1 > (name: identifier) (args: args) dashline (clause_name: identifier) 
 ["identifier"]:
     stmt:clause_no_name@0 -> "relation"@1 > (name: identifier) (args: args) dashline "{" (goals: goals) "}" 
 and so on ...
