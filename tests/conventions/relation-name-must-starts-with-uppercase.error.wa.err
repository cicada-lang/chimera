[Script.run] ./tests/conventions/relation-name-must-starts-with-uppercase.error.wa
I found syntax error in code:

 1 |border ["sussex", "kent"]
 2 |


Found the identifier "border" in [0, 6], while expecting:
 ["identifier"]:
     stmt:relation_no_goals_no_clause_name@0 -> > (name: identifier) (exp: exp) 
 ["identifier"]:
     stmt:relation_no_goals@0 -> > (name: identifier) (exp: exp) dashline (clause_name: identifier) 
 ["identifier"]:
     stmt:relation_no_clause_name@0 -> > (name: identifier) (exp: exp) dashline "{" (goals: goals) "}" 
 and so on ...
